# Feature-Extraction
A pipeline for feature extraction of experimental fluid dynamics data

The data is the velocity vectors of flow field obtained from flow images. The data is examined using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to identify the princial components for the flow field velocity. The obtained principal components can be used to examine the dominent modes for a fluid dynamics phenomenon.
